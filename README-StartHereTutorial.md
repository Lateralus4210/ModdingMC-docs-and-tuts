Prerequisites
It's strongly recommended to learn Java before diving into the modding world (especially if you don't have prior programming experience). Minecraft, in its codebase, and mods, using Fabric API, use more advanced Java concepts like lambdas, generics and polymorphism. If you don't know all of these concepts, you may have some difficulties modding. Here are some online resources that will help learning Java.

### 🧠 TOP-LEVEL DIRS TO KNOW
- 📁 `bin/`  
  - Created by some IDEs (like Eclipse)  
  - Temporary compiled class files  
  - Can usually be ignored or deleted

- 📁 `build/`  
  - Generated by Gradle during build or run  
  - Contains compiled code and jar output  
  - Should not be tracked by Git

- 📁 `gradle/`  
  - Internal Gradle setup and wrapper config  
  - Required for `gradlew` scripts to work  
  - Rarely edited directly

- 📁 `src/`  <!>
  - Your actual mod code and resources  
  - Contains `main/`, `client/`, and `resources/`  
  - Core development happens here

---

### 🧠 CORE SUBDIRS TO KNOW
- 📁 `src/main/java/`  
  - Shared code — runs on both client and server  
  - Your main mod class (e.g. `ZachsHax.java`)  
  - Register items, blocks, events

- 📁 `src/client/java/`  
  - Client-only code  
  - GUIs, renderers, keybindings, HUD overlays  
  - Accesses `MinecraftClient` (don’t use on server)

- 📁 `src/main/resources/`  
  - `fabric.mod.json` → metadata config  
  - `assets/modid/` → language files, models, textures, sounds  
  - `data/modid/` → recipes, loot tables, tags (used by game logic)

- 📁 `build.gradle`  
  - Controls build configuration, dependencies, and Minecraft version

---

### 🧠 ROOT FILES TO KNOW
- 📄 `build.gradle`  
  - Main build script for your mod  
  - Declares dependencies, Minecraft version, mappings, mod ID  
  - Controls how your mod is built and run

- 📄 `gradle.properties`  
  - Stores project-wide settings (e.g. mod version, Java version)  
  - Used by `build.gradle` to inject values like `${version}`  
  - Good place to centralize configuration

- 📄 `gradlew`  
  - Unix shell script for running Gradle without needing it installed globally  
  - Used for `./gradlew build`, `runClient`, etc.  
  - Always commit this file

- 📄 `gradlew.bat`  
  - Windows version of `gradlew`  
  - Same purpose, different platform  
  - Also should be committed

- 📄 `LICENSE`  
  - Defines the legal terms for using/modifying your mod  
  - By default it’s set to CC0 (public domain)  
  - You can change this to MIT, LGPL, etc. if needed

- 📄 `settings.gradle`  
  - Tells Gradle the name of your root project  
  - Required for Gradle to initialize properly  
  - Usually left untouched after initial setup

### 🧠 CORE FILES TO KNOW

- 📄 `ExampleMod.java`  
  - Main mod entry point that runs when the mod loads  
  - Implements `ModInitializer`  
  - Register items, blocks, events, etc.  
  📍 `src/main/java/.../ExampleMod.java`

- 📄 `ExampleModClient.java`  
  - Optional client-only entry point  
  - Good for HUD rendering, key bindings, entity renderers  
  - Implements `ClientModInitializer`  
  📍 `src/client/java/.../ExampleModClient.java`

- 📄 `fabric.mod.json`  
  - Defines mod ID, version, entrypoints, dependencies, mixins (if any)  
  📍 `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`

- 📄 Language & Assets  
  - Sets item/block names, models, textures  
  - Handled via lang, model, and texture JSONs  
  📍 `assets/[modid]/lang/en_us.json`, `textures/...`, `models/...`

- 📄 `[modid].mixins.json` + `/mixin/`  
  - Declares and implements Mixins (modifications to vanilla behavior)  
  📍 `src/main/resources/[modid].mixins.json`, `src/main/java/.../mixin/`

- 📄 `build.gradle`  
  - Controls builds, dependencies, and Minecraft version  
  📍 `build.gradle`


### 🧠 SRC FOLDER STRUCTURE

- 📁 `src/main/`  
  - Shared code and resources used on **both client and server**  
  - Contains Java files, JSON configs, assets, and mod metadata

- 📁 `src/client/`  
  - Client-only code (never runs on a dedicated server)  
  - Contains things like GUI code, keybindings, rendering logic


### 🧠 `src/main/` — SHARED CODE & RESOURCES

  - 📁 `java/`  
    - Core mod logic shared by both client and server  
    - Your main mod class lives here (e.g. `ZachsHax.java`)  
    - Register items, blocks, events, commands, etc.  
    📍 `src/main/java/com/zachshax/...`

  - 📁 `resources/`  
  - Non-code assets used by your mod  
  - Includes your mod metadata and all data Minecraft loads

  - 📄 `fabric.mod.json`  
    - Declares your mod's ID, version, entrypoints, dependencies, and mixins  
    📍 `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`

  - 📁 `assets/[modid]/`  
    - Stores language files, textures, models, sounds, etc.  
    - These control how things *look and sound*  
    📍 `lang/`, `textures/`, `models/`, etc.

  - 📁 `data/[modid]/`  
    - Stores recipes, loot tables, advancement triggers, and tags  
    - These control how things *behave and interact*  
    📍 `recipes/`, `loot_tables/`, `tags/`, etc.






### 🧠 MOD EXECUTION FLOW — How your mod starts, in order

- 📄 ./gradlew runClient  
  Builds and launches Minecraft in a dev environment  
  Reads settings from Gradle files  
  Loads your mod and opens the game client  

- 📄 settings.gradle, build.gradle, gradle.properties  
  settings.gradle     → defines the project name  
  build.gradle        → declares dependencies, mappings, loader version  
  gradle.properties   → defines mod version, Java version, etc.  

- 📄 fabric.mod.json  
  Metadata that tells Fabric Loader how to load your mod  
  Defines mod ID, version, entrypoints, mixins, dependencies  

- 📄 Modname.java  
  Implements ModInitializer (runs on client & server)  
  Called when Minecraft boots  
  Use to register items, blocks, game events, etc.  

- 📄 ZachsHaxClient.java  
  Implements ClientModInitializer  
  Runs only on the client  
  Use for GUIs, keybindings, HUDs, client-only listeners  

- 📁 mixin/, *.mixins.json  
  JSON: Lists what vanilla classes to target  
  Java: Uses @Mixin and @Inject to modify Minecraft behavior  
  Mixins apply before game logic starts  

- 🕹️ Game Launches  
  Fabric loads mods listed in fabric.mod.json  
  Calls entrypoints: onInitialize() and onInitializeClient()  
  Applies Mixins  
  Game reaches title screen — your mod is live

  - @ symbol means is an annotation in Java - mark parts of code for special treatment at runtime
