# 🧠 TOP-LEVEL DIRS TO KNOW
- 📁 `bin/`  
  - Created by some IDEs (like Eclipse)  
  - Temporary compiled class files  
  - Can usually be ignored or deleted

- 📁 `build/`  
  - Generated by Gradle during build or run  
  - Contains compiled code and jar output  
  - Should not be tracked by Git

- 📁 `gradle/`  
  - Internal Gradle setup and wrapper config  
  - Required for `gradlew` scripts to work  
  - Rarely edited directly

- 📁 `src/`  <!>
  - Your actual mod code and resources  
  - Contains `main/`, `client/`, and `resources/`  
  - Core development happens here

---

# 🧠 CORE SUBDIRS TO KNOW
- 📁 `src/main/java/`  
  - Shared code — runs on both client and server  
  - Your main mod class (e.g. `ZachsHax.java`)  
  - Register items, blocks, events

- 📁 `src/client/java/`  
  - Client-only code  
  - GUIs, renderers, keybindings, HUD overlays  
  - Accesses `MinecraftClient` (don’t use on server)

- 📁 `src/main/resources/`  
  - `fabric.mod.json` → metadata config  
  - `assets/modid/` → language files, models, textures, sounds  
  - `data/modid/` → recipes, loot tables, tags (used by game logic)

- 📁 `build.gradle`  
  - Controls build configuration, dependencies, and Minecraft version

---

# 🧠 ROOT FILES TO KNOW
- 📄 `build.gradle`  
  - Main build script for your mod  
  - Declares dependencies, Minecraft version, mappings, mod ID  
  - Controls how your mod is built and run

- 📄 `gradle.properties`  
  - Stores project-wide settings (e.g. mod version, Java version)  
  - Used by `build.gradle` to inject values like `${version}`  
  - Good place to centralize configuration

- 📄 `gradlew`  
  - Unix shell script for running Gradle without needing it installed globally  
  - Used for `./gradlew build`, `runClient`, etc.  
  - Always commit this file

- 📄 `gradlew.bat`  
  - Windows version of `gradlew`  
  - Same purpose, different platform  
  - Also should be committed

- 📄 `LICENSE`  
  - Defines the legal terms for using/modifying your mod  
  - By default it’s set to CC0 (public domain)  
  - You can change this to MIT, LGPL, etc. if needed

- 📄 `settings.gradle`  
  - Tells Gradle the name of your root project  
  - Required for Gradle to initialize properly  
  - Usually left untouched after initial setup

# 🧠 CORE FILES TO KNOW

- 📄 `ExampleMod.java`  
  - Main mod entry point that runs when the mod loads  
  - Implements `ModInitializer`  
  - Register items, blocks, events, etc.  
  📍 `src/main/java/.../ExampleMod.java`

- 📄 `ExampleModClient.java`  
  - Optional client-only entry point  
  - Good for HUD rendering, key bindings, entity renderers  
  - Implements `ClientModInitializer`  
  📍 `src/client/java/.../ExampleModClient.java`

- 📄 `fabric.mod.json`  
  - Defines mod ID, version, entrypoints, dependencies, mixins (if any)  
  📍 `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`

- 📄 Language & Assets  
  - Sets item/block names, models, textures  
  - Handled via lang, model, and texture JSONs  
  📍 `assets/[modid]/lang/en_us.json`, `textures/...`, `models/...`

- 📄 `[modid].mixins.json` + `/mixin/`  
  - Declares and implements Mixins (modifications to vanilla behavior)  
  📍 `src/main/resources/[modid].mixins.json`, `src/main/java/.../mixin/`

- 📄 `build.gradle`  
  - Controls builds, dependencies, and Minecraft version  
  📍 `build.gradle`

# 🧠 SRC FOLDER STRUCTURE

- 📁 `src/main/`  
  - Shared code and resources used on **both client and server**  
  - Contains Java files, JSON configs, assets, and mod metadata

- 📁 `src/client/`  
  - Client-only code (never runs on a dedicated server)  
  - Contains things like GUI code, keybindings, rendering logic


 ### 🧠 `src/main/` — SHARED CODE & RESOURCES

  - 📁 `java/`  
    - Core mod logic shared by both client and server  
    - Your main mod class lives here (e.g. `ZachsHax.java`)  
    - Register items, blocks, events, commands, etc.  
    📍 `src/main/java/com/zachshax/...`

  - 📁 `resources/`  
  - Non-code assets used by your mod  
  - Includes your mod metadata and all data Minecraft loads

  - 📄 `fabric.mod.json`  
    - Declares your mod's ID, version, entrypoints, dependencies, and mixins  
    📍 `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`

  - 📁 `assets/[modid]/`  
    - Stores language files, textures, models, sounds, etc.  
    - These control how things *look and sound*  
    📍 `lang/`, `textures/`, `models/`, etc.

  - 📁 `data/[modid]/`  
    - Stores recipes, loot tables, advancement triggers, and tags  
    - These control how things *behave and interact*  
    📍 `recipes/`, `loot_tables/`, `tags/`, etc.






## 🧠 MOD EXECUTION FLOW — How your mod starts, in order

- 📄 ./gradlew runClient  
  Builds and launches Minecraft in a dev environment  
  Reads settings from Gradle files  
  Loads your mod and opens the game client  

- 📄 settings.gradle, build.gradle, gradle.properties  
  settings.gradle     → defines the project name  
  build.gradle        → declares dependencies, mappings, loader version  
  gradle.properties   → defines mod version, Java version, etc.  

- 📄 fabric.mod.json  
  Metadata that tells Fabric Loader how to load your mod  
  Defines mod ID, version, entrypoints, mixins, dependencies  

- 📄 Modname.java  
  Implements ModInitializer (runs on client & server)  
  Called when Minecraft boots  
  Use to register items, blocks, game events, etc.  

- 📄 ZachsHaxClient.java  
  Implements ClientModInitializer  
  Runs only on the client  
  Use for GUIs, keybindings, HUDs, client-only listeners  

- 📁 mixin/, *.mixins.json  
  JSON: Lists what vanilla classes to target  
  Java: Uses @Mixin and @Inject to modify Minecraft behavior  
  Mixins apply before game logic starts  

- 🕹️ Game Launches  
  Fabric loads mods listed in fabric.mod.json  
  Calls entrypoints: onInitialize() and onInitializeClient()  
  Applies Mixins  
  Game reaches title screen — your mod is live
