# Concepts to use
Comment lines (and the Ctrl + / shortcut in VSC)
Using alt for multiple cursors
Highlight a selection then use (), [], or ``` to enclose it quickly
(Note the difference between ` and ' (backtick versus single quote mark / apostrophe))
Using Alt + {Up}/{Down} to quickly move entire lines or selections

# Misc

-check out some simple terminal - command line games on YouTube that use Java (doesn't have to be in VSC, IDEs tend to look the same)

-take things slowly - make sure to at least try to understand what's happening line by line 

-try to avoid copy-pasting from somewhere else and go through the motions of actually typing the code

-when vibe-coding, notice the changes the LLM made and be cognizant of them

-brush up on Java syntax conventions (you'll also absorb this quickly just by seeing Java code snippets and playing around typing your own snippets) like: 
    - camelCase (eg doWeatherCycle, rideTheLightning) 

    - PascalCase (eg StAngerRoundMyNeck, WatchHimBecomeAGod) 

    - CAPITALIZED used for constants, as in, values that are technically "variables" but are not actually meant to be changed (during debugging for instance) (eg GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT= .000000000066743, PI=3.14156)

    - sub_underscores_for_special_chars - any spot you would see an "illegal" character like "." "," " " etc, use an underscore instead.
